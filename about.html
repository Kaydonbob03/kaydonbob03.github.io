                <img src="images/kayden.jpg" alt="Kayden Cormier" class="profile-pic" width="300px" height="450px"/>
                <p>Hi, I'm Kayden Cormier, a passionate software developer, full-stack enthusiast, cybersecurity hobbyist, and gamer. Currently, I'm in my second year of the Computer Programming program at Sault College with intentions to go back for a year of cybersecurity or for the advanced diploma, I havent decided yet.</p>
                
                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>Currently writing a biography for myself. Will put everything here when its done. This page is a work in progress</p>
                
                <!-- <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
                <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy a variety of hobbies and interests that keep me engaged and inspired:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> I love playing video games, especially those that challenge my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reading:</strong> I enjoy reading books on technology, cybersecurity, and science fiction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Outdoor Activities:</strong> Hiking, biking, and exploring nature help me stay active and refreshed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Music:</strong> I play the guitar and enjoy composing my own music.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Skills and Experience</h3>
                <p>Here are some of the technical skills I've developed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, Java, HTML, CSS</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Microsoft Office Apps, Adobe (Premiere Pro, Photoshop, InDesign)</li>
                    <li><strong>Computer Repairs:</strong> BIOS, Hardware, Software</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Throughout my academic and personal projects, I have applied these skills to develop various applications, from web applications to game prototypes. My experience includes working with different teams, managing projects, and continuously learning new technologies.</p>
                
                <h3>Future Goals</h3>
                <p>I aim to transition into full-time development to make my ideas accessible to a wider audience. I also plan to expand my skill set by learning C, C++, and C# in the future. Additionally, I would like to pursue my hobby of cybersecurity more and maybe see about future employment in that field.</p>
                <p>My long-term goal is to contribute to innovative projects that have a positive impact on society. I am particularly interested in areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and game development. I believe that technology has the power to transform lives, and I am excited to be a part of that journey.</p> -->
